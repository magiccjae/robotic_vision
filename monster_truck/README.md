Each subdirectory here is a project directory. IOIO is pronounced "yoyo".

MyIOIOApp is a very simple app that allows and android device to send steering and power commands to the truck. This is mainly used for testing the connection.

MyOpenCVApp is a visual processing app without any integration with the truck. I never used this much.

MyVisionDriveApp is an app that does visual processing and truck commands at the same time. The meat is found in the MyVisionDriveApp.java file.
